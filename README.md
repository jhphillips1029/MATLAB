<h1>JP's MATLAB Repo</h1>
<p>The files here are meant as a helping-hand as you complete the assignments or as a hopeful clarification on subject matter. It is not my intention for this repo to be used by other students to complete their work for them. It is just easier for me to help people debug their code if I can pull my working code up next to theirs.</p>
<p>In other words, <b>don't fucking cheat.</b></p>
<p>Files are named by the following convention:</p>
<h6>[Assignment type (WS-worksheet,A-assignment,etc][Number]-[Assignment Name].[File Extension]</h6>
